# Parking-Sensor-System-Using-Arduino
This project presents an intelligent Parking Navigation System designed to assist drivers in efficiently locating vacant parking spaces in real-time. It uses Infrared (IR) sensors and an Arduino Uno to monitor the occupancy status of parking slots. The system provides both visual (LED) and textual (LCD) feedback, enabling users to identify which slots are free or occupied instantly.

As urban areas face increased traffic and limited parking availability, this solution helps reduce congestion, driver frustration, and fuel wastage by optimizing parking management.
